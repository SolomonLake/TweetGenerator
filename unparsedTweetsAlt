    The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize! Nov 19, 2016
    Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen! Nov 19, 2016
    The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad! Nov 19, 2016

    My transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today. #MAGA Nov 17, 2016
    Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me. Nov 16, 2016
    I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Nov 16, 2016
    The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders. Nov 16, 2016

    The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different! Nov 15, 2016
    If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily Nov 15, 2016
    The debates, especially the second and third, plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies, plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS, gave us the win! Nov 13, 2016
    I will be interviewed on @60Minutes tonight after the NFL game - 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! Nov 13, 2016

    Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice! Nov 13, 2016
    The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it? Nov 13, 2016
    Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the "Trump phenomena" Nov 13, 2016
    This will prove to be a great time in the lives of ALL Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win! Nov 12, 2016

    The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake. Sad! Sep 04, 2016
    The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @JeffFlake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration. Sep 04, 2016
    "@AnneBellar: @realDonaldTrump @CNN CNN is so biased. Never ever watch them. Trump 2016!!" Sep 04, 2016
    Crooked Hillary's V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie - and taken over during O term! Sep 04, 2016
    Wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source Sep 04, 2016
    .@CNN is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals. Sep 03, 2016

    "Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents! Aug 15, 2016
    I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so! Aug 14, 2016
    It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false! Aug 14, 2016
    I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it! Aug 14, 2016
    Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose! Aug 14, 2016
    My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm. Aug 14, 2016
    If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20% Aug 14, 2016
    The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said Aug 14, 2016

    A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP, NAFTA, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees. Jul 28, 2016

    Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic Jul 27, 2016
    Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz! Jul 27, 2016
    Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO! Jul 27, 2016
    Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough! Jul 27, 2016
    The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD! Jul 27, 2016
    Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st! Jul 27, 2016
    As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv. Jul 27, 2016
    Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP. https://t.co/eoNTWK6I8y Jul 27, 2016
    Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep? Jul 27, 2016
    I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention! Jul 27, 2016
    No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated! Jul 27, 2016
    You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkelly Jul 27, 2016
    For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia. Jul 26, 2016
    In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy! Jul 26, 2016
    Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here. Jul 26, 2016
    Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed! Jul 26, 2016
    The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar! Jul 26, 2016

    Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch. Jul 26, 2016
    Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great Jul 26, 2016
    Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference Jul 26, 2016
    Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time. Jul 26, 2016
    Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated! Jul 26, 2016
    Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs. Jul 26, 2016
    If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself. Jul 26, 2016
    I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing. He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air! Jul 25, 2016
    Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke! Jul 25, 2016
    While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers. Jul 25, 2016
    Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War. Jul 25, 2016

    Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA Jul 25, 2016
    The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE! Jul 25, 2016
    Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn! Jul 25, 2016
    Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance! Jul 25, 2016
    Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie. Jul 25, 2016
    If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same. Jul 25, 2016
    Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzam Jul 25, 2016
    Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened! Jul 25, 2016
    How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie! Jul 25, 2016
    The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me Jul 25, 2016
    Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing! Jul 24, 2016
    The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you! Jul 24, 2016
    The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out! Jul 24, 2016
    The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well! Jul 24, 2016
    Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook! Jul 24, 2016
    Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out Jul 24, 2016
    If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild Jul 24, 2016
    The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN! Jul 24, 2016
    I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left! Jul 24, 2016
    Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.) Jul 24, 2016
    Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD! Jul 24, 2016
    There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end! Jul 24, 2016
    An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates. Jul 24, 2016
    Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite! Jul 24, 2016
    Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else! Jul 24, 2016
    Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT Jul 24, 2016
    The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H! Jul 24, 2016

    The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud! Jul 23, 2016
    Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me! Jul 23, 2016
    I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs! Jul 23, 2016
    Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer! Jul 23, 2016
    Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back! Jul 23, 2016
    Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA. Jul 23, 2016
    Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED Jul 23, 2016
    Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her! Jul 23, 2016
    Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing! Jul 23, 2016
    The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight? Jul 23, 2016
    "@Theresa_Cali: @realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain" Jul 23, 2016

    The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails. Jul 20, 2016
    Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press! Jul 20, 2016
    In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs! Jul 20, 2016

    Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton. Jul 12, 2016

    Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City. Jul 06, 2016

    I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies. Jul 06, 2016

    Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." Not fit! Jul 06, 2016
    Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT! Jul 06, 2016
    I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8, she's out! Jul 06, 2016

    The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this! Jul 04, 2016
    In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed! Jul 04, 2016
    I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught! Jul 03, 2016
    The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away, no pictures." Jul 03, 2016
    Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac? Jul 03, 2016

    Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know. Jul 03, 2016
    Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it! Jul 03, 2016
    It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged! Jul 02, 2016

    On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night! Apr 25, 2016
    Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work. Apr 25, 2016
    Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses. Apr 25, 2016
    Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness! Apr 25, 2016
    Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad! Apr 25, 2016
    Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION! Apr 25, 2016
    I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant! Apr 25, 2016

    .@Borisep was great on @JudgeJeanine tonight. Very smart commentary that will prove to be correct! Apr 24, 2016
    As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads, he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton. I will win! Apr 24, 2016

    Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted. Apr 21, 2016
    Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify! Apr 21, 2016
    Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out! Apr 21, 2016
